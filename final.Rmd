## Look at the distribution of all varibales:
```{r}
cancer_raw %>%
  keep(is.numeric) %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
    facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```

## Choose variables:
```{r}
cancer_county =
  cancer_raw %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  dplyr::select(target_death_rate, incidence_rate, med_income, poverty_percent, median_age:median_age_female, avg_household_size:pct_married_households) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-pct_hs25_over, -pct_bach_deg25_over, -pct_employed16_over, -percent_married) %>%
  mutate(pct_upto_hs18_24 = pct_no_hs18_24 + pct_hs18_24, 
         pct_above_hs18_24 = 100 - pct_upto_hs18_24,
         pct_with_coverage = pct_private_coverage + pct_public_coverage_alone,
         income_cat = ifelse(med_income < 35000, 0, 1)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-(pct_no_hs18_24:pct_bach_deg18_24), -pct_above_hs18_24, -(pct_private_coverage:pct_public_coverage_alone), -med_income)
```

## Check correlation and distribution:

```{r}
cor(cancer_county) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

cancer_county %>%
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) 
```

##The discriptive statistics:

```{r}

  min = min(x)
  median = median(x)
  var = var(x)
  sd = sd(x) 
  sample_size = length(x) - sum(is.na(x))
  tibble(mean, max, min, median, var, sd, sample_size) 
}

##Model building:

####Stepwise:
```{r}
# building full model
full_model <- lm(target_death_rate ~., data = cancer_county)
summary(full_model)

# Using the stepwise 
stepwise_model = stepAIC(full_model, direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
summary(stepwise_model)

vif(stepwise_model) 

# Cp and AIC and Adjusted R2
model_dig = glance(stepwise_model) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  dplyr::select(adj.r.squared, sigma, p.value, AIC, BIC) %>% 
  rename(RES = sigma) %>% 
  mutate(cp = ols_mallows_cp(stepwise_model, full_model))

model_dig
```

## Cross validation and Criterion method summery

```{r}
cross_df = crossv_mc(cancer_county, n = 100, test = 0.2) 

cross_result = 
  cross_df %>% 
  mutate(
    step_mod = map(train, ~lm(target_death_rate ~ incidence_rate + poverty_percent + 
    median_age_male + pct_unemployed16_over + pct_white + pct_asian + 
    pct_other_race + pct_married_households + pct_upto_hs18_24 + 
    pct_with_coverage + income_cat, data = .x)),
    rmse_train = map2_dbl(step_mod, train, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_test = map2_dbl(step_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
    )
  

mse_results = cross_result %>% 
  dplyr::select(rmse_train, rmse_test) %>%
  summarize(mse_train = (mean(rmse_train))^2,
            mse_test = (mean(rmse_test))^2) #mse results

#LOOCV
glm.fit = glm(target_death_rate ~ incidence_rate + poverty_percent + 
    median_age_male + pct_unemployed16_over + pct_white + pct_asian + 
    pct_other_race + pct_married_households + pct_upto_hs18_24 + 
    pct_with_coverage + income_cat, data = cancer_county)

cv.err = cv.glm(cancer_county, glm.fit)

# The two delta values should be similar: we use the first one
# The second value is bias corrected
cv.err$delta   #434.8355

anova(stepwise_model)[12, 3] #MSE: 431

```

##Bootstrap
```{r}
cancer_county %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(models = map(strap, ~lm(target_death_rate ~ incidence_rate + poverty_percent + 
    median_age_male + pct_unemployed16_over + pct_white + pct_asian + 
    pct_other_race + pct_married_households + pct_upto_hs18_24 + 
    pct_with_coverage + income_cat, data = .x)),
         results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  group_by(term) %>% 
  summarize(boot_se = sd(estimate))
```



## Outliers
```{r, message = FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(stepwise_model) # we observe the 282, 1059 are outliers

# Using the studentized residuals
stu_res_step <- rstandard(stepwise_model)
outliers_y_step = stu_res_step[abs(stu_res_step) > 2.5]
outliers_y_step

# various measure of influence
influence.measures(stepwise_model) %>% 
  summary() #we observe the 282, 1059 are potential outliers
```

# Remove outliers:
```{r}

# filter outlier 282
step_model_no_282 <- cancer_county %>% 
  dplyr::select(-median_age, -pct_black, -median_age_female, avg_household_size) %>% 
  tibble::rowid_to_column() %>%
