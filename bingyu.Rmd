Low income was defined as the lowest quartile of incomes (<$35,000)

**By county**
```{r}

##Model building

###Automatic Procedures

* Use alpha = 0.15 (exploratory analysis: be less stringent)

#### Regression model with all the variables

```{r}
fit_all = lm(target_death_rate ~ ., data = cancer_county)
summary(fit_all)
```

#### Stepwise

```{r}
step(fit_all, direction = 'backward') #select by AIC
```
