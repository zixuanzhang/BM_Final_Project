After lit review, I chose these variables:
target_death_rate, med_income, poverty_percent, median_age, median_age_male, median_age_female, geography, pct_no_hs18_24, pct_hs18_24, pct_some_col18_24, pct_bach_deg18_24, pct_hs25_over, pct_bach_deg25_over, pct_employed16_over, pct_unemployed16_over, pct_white, pct_black, pct_asian, pct_other_race
